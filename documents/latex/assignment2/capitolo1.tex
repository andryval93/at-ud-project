\subsection{Activity Scenarious}
\subsubsection{Mario}
Mario's going to university. After meeting a friend and having a coffee, they decide to start studying. Although we have successfully completed all the exercises, he has doubts about the correctness of a process. He decides to ask his friend for help.  But there are communication difficulties, so Mario remembers to have the ProSigne application and you'll use the text-to-speach function. With this feature, the two of them overcome the communication difficulties and dispel the various doubts about the exercise.

\subsubsection{Luca}
As a social student, he decided to improve his knowledge of the ASL language, after having encountered several problems of communication with a friend. He decides to start this improvement process using the ProSign application. He starts with a review of the alphabet and known words and then moves on to new words or phrases. In the end, again through ProSign, he decides to video call a friend to test his skills.
